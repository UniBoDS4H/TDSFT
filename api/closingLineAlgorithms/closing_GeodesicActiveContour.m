% NAME: TDSFT (version 1.0)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   - fusionResult (Matrix [height, width]):
%       the result of the fusion process.
%       It is a not-close segmentation that needs to be closed.
%   - inputSegmentations (Cell array: [1, raters], Cells: matrix [height, width]):
%       the segmentations used for the fusion process.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   - res (Matrix: [height, width]):
%       the resulting segmentation after the closing process.

% DESCRIPTION:
%   Use the Geodesic Active Contour algorithm to close a result of the fusion process which is not closed.
%
%   This technique is based on active contours evolving in time according to intrinsic geometric measures of the image.
%   The evolving contours naturally split and merge, allowing the simultaneous detection of several objects and both interior 
%   and exterior boundaries. The proposed approach is based on the relation between active contours and the computation of geodesics
%   or minimal distance curves.
