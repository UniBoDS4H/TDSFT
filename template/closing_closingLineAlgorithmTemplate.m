% NAME:   TDSFT (version 1.0)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   - fusionResult (Matrix [height, width]):
%       the result of the fusion process.
%       It is a not-close line that needs to be closed.
%   - inputSegmentations (Cell array: [1, raters], Cells: matrix [height, width]):
%       the segmentations used for the fusion process.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   - res (Matrix: [height, width]):
%       the resulting segmentation after the closing process.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Function template for the implementation of a closing line algorithm.
%   Copy this file to the folder "api/closingLineAlgorithms" and rename it
%   with the name of the algorithm you want to implement (the name has to start
%   with "closing_"). Then, implement the function.
function res = closing_closingLineAlgorithmTemplate(fusionResult, inputSegmentations)   
    % Insert here your code
